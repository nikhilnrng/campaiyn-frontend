# Campaiyn

### Overview

Campaiyn is a web-based marketplace to rent out privately owned spaces for commercial advertising. Campaiyn allows anybody with commercially viable space to post a listing, connect with advertisers professionals, and rent out their space for marketing campaigns. 

This repository is a subset of our platform, containing only front-end files. The complete platform is a fully functional marketplace that can be applied, with front-end modifications, to any application that aims to connect two users through a listing. The following features are available on our platform: 

- Create a profile: username/password, email verification
- Manage account: add "about me" information and a profile picture
- Create a listing: list your space, provide images and relevant advertising details
- Search listings: find listings in an area where you want to make impressions
- Inquire about a Listing: message a user about their listing and begin a campaign
- Checkout and send a payment: work out pricing and send money directly through the app
- Connect a Bank Account: transfer money to and from your bank account

### Tech

This project has a few prerequisities: Node.js, Node Package Manager (npm), MongoDB (version 2.6), and the Sails.js framework (sails). Sails is our backend framework. React is our frontend framework, along with Material-UI to help aid the theme direction with React. The frontend framework is integrated into Sails via the 'assets/' folder, so no prerequisites are required for it. MongoDB is used as the database for the project.

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - facebook's library for user interfaces
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/) - front-end agnostic web framework for Node.js apps
